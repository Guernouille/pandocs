This folder contains the source code and the datasets used to generate some plots.

Those plots are included in Pan Docs as normal SVG figures, but their generation is part of pipeline.

The scripts are traditional matplotlib executions but you may notice some additional manipulation on the resulting SVGs to set the lines and text to CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors.
